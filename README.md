# Hello_World

Hello Everyone!

I am currently getting a Masters of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) at The University of Iowa.
I have my undergraduate degree in data science and I am new to GitHub.
I hope to learn all the in-and-outs and cool tricks that GitHub has to offer to be able to code
and collaborate with other people.
